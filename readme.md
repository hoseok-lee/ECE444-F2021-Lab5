# Activity 6

The form in the new UI has bolded text to highlight more important information, in addition to well-placed linebreaks for readability. The addition of colour and bolded text allows the user to easily follow the important points of the webpage. It is also seen in the feedback text, which is italicized in a lighter colour, making it low on importance and reading order.
